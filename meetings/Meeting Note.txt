============ Meeting Oct 2nd with Alda 
	1. Classification in approaches. Must be more detailed. Critical they done something, done something wrong, find problem, write critisize
	2. By your own words.
	3. swarm optimisation understanding
	4. Literature, coherent
	5. Student in Fitness Landscape
	
============ Meeting Oct 6th with Bernd
	1. Answer his questions to direct research
	
============ Meeting Oct 7th with Alda
	1. Find out crowd parameters
	
============ Meeting Oct 13rd with Bernd, Alda
	1. Data could be collected from real-time observation in high density, not only from parameters contributing running models
	2. Data could be collected from adjusting models, validate and adapting models, calibration techniques
	3. Information to detect flow from mobile, approximately?
	
============ Meeting Oct 20nd with Bernd
	Just similar data, or simpler data, more available from infrastructure
	More flexible, how these data (other resources) can interact with current models (in micro models, or in meso -aggregation models) 
	(GPS, Proximity, occlusion, tracking whole trajectory of pedestrian's commute)
	
	1- new factors that camera cannot extract
		+ Read papers about validation, calibration, mobile folders. calibrate & adjust this in continuum & network models in real time. IN WHICH, WHERE, WHEN SCENARIOS CAMERA SURVEILLANCE CAN'T WORK 
		+ Read one paper about continuum & network models to add our information
		+ Read papers about leadership, proximity how group together, breakout, smoothly, roughly, fine-grain, trajectory escaping - realistic can not get from camera.
		+ Read papers of Cebrian, other collected papers
		
		+ Camera position + gps proximity measures:
			where when, time possible position could lead to high crowd pressure, density, turbulence- Time-location table of pedestrian, could be add on the model on that camera
			crowd pressure + turbulence transition at location, time
			where and when the lane could be formatted, expected density, lane average velocity when we know the camera position, when the user will increase speed	
			where when leadership can be created and break-out, smoothly or roughly ?
			what kind of global path pedestrian is in
		
		In panic:
			+ GPS + proximity + graph clustering -> habit path movement (time table + position probabilities /pedestrian), who you will follow (relationship-proximity + same GPS), herding [CURRENT MODEL DOESN'T DO KNOW, THERE ARE ONLY ON FISH STUDY]	
			+ Heat map of crowd pressure, local body compression (when crowd high density, acceleration increase energy high but position doesn't change) -> stampede, turbulence
			+ Acceleration similar in consecutive segments, position dones'nt change much, or change with the low SD -> stop-go waves. Which segment causes stop-go waves
		In evacuation:
			+PSO on GPS proximity, to find global optimal place, current position what is next
			
	2- calibrate, adjust models in both micro, meso, macro levels
	3- adjust model, thinks about real time emergency evacuation factor combinations
	4- compliment, interface, interact them when camera hasn't setup yet

============ Meeting Nov 5rd with Alda
	(who is familiar with that infrastructure layout, we know where they will turn right or left, and when he moves faster) 
	1. update sharing file with (velocity entropy in cell size, definition of Crowd Pressure, Turbulence , make clear three approaches by figures)
