Camera Data -> interchangeable pedestrian, over the time, cost, completed capturing views, occlusion
limitations on validation in fact, cost storing, difficult-to-setup camera surveillance, need human experience to guide evacuation plan dynamic hazardous dangerous environment.
This is hard combinatorial problem, because we can statistic about its damages but it is difficult to predict, it depends on various factors (human density, current location, damage at where) 

Mobile phone, real-time, lower storing cost, identifiable pedestrian

-in crowd modelling -micro level
	+ track evacuation route trajectory
	+ route choice behaviour on cognitive level, 
	+ physical attributes ( speeds, how desire distance to obstacle), friend physiological force graph
	
	Important to scale data for analysing crowd dynamics simulation from collected agents to test whether they are panic (for various infrastructure layout assessment)
	Important to track evacuation route search space and generate hazard functions

	Validation model:
			by data collected in two days or two-fold validation approach (divide ahalf to calibrate agent parameter(physical attributes)
			by ask survey, whether they go on route choice, experience
	Collect data in real emergence situation:
	+deploy in various high dense situation, to help us know disaster's properties, or from using reports from other people
	
-in crowd modelling -meso level
	+ monitoring speed, density of micro flows as response function for adaptive cost function
	
-in crowd modelling -macro level
	+check crowd density instead of using camera in cost

	
-in disaster prevent, dealing with multiple exit, adaptive cost function (on minimize evacuation time, or hazardous information) by exploiting various optimisation techniques
	
	+pre-disaster
		+express search space to raise awareness to people
		+real-time generate heat map (density) in difficult situation
		+raise awareness about hazardous congestion vertices and edges
			+ vertices: most desire when evacuating
			+ vertices: most desire when de-tour
			+ edges: the most visited edges of people in building
	+during disaster
		+use above hazard functions and real-time data and search space to optimise solutions in dynamic hazardous environment
		+keep bio- connection and visualize the route without human experience guide
		
Case Studies		
1- pre-disaster prevention in Floor6 FIT Monash
			+indoor position, density heat-map
			+show evacuation route search space
			+raise awareness about search space, (desired implicit and explicit congestion, visiting frequency on edges of human in buildings)
			+apply ACO to find potential evacuation route at different time table
			+physical attributes when changing architecture layouts
			
2- enhance crowd modelling on micro models in conference forum in 2 days
			+ route choice behaviour with survey ask whether they are familiar yet
			+ route choice in 2nd days by artificial obstacles (human) -like Couzin's experiment
			+ extract human physical attributes
			+ filtering people has various trajectories and apply whether the model is corrected, satisfy with extracted physical attributes
			+ assess by simulating with other infrastructure layouts with collected attributes
			
3- Simulate real-time again in that conference forum to real-time infer evacuation route and return to agents by turn off ibeacon devices
