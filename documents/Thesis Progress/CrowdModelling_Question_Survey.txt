Exploring newly real-time collectable data from mobile to enhance current theoretical models to applicable model for real disaster prevention purpose.

Primary question: What are newly collectable data to enhance current model?

1. What is current crowd model on micro, macro levels?
	Micro: force, CA, ABM, force-agent model to resolve problem of force(physical attribute,force affect, route choice, behavior). Inspired by biological route choice (school fish, ant)
	Macro: network, continuum
	
2. What data has been used in current models, how they enhance current model?
	From camera approach:
		2009_Data Driven for Crowd Modelling
		2011_Consequence of Turning Movements during emergency crowd egress
		2012_Detection and Simulation of Dangerous Human
		2014_Route Choice Modelling and Runtime optimisation for Simulation
		Standford_ http://eig.stanford.edu/safegress/
	Show exactly parameters can't be collected in real-time.
	
	Or just detection abnormal behaviour based on force models.
		2011_Analyzing Pedestrian Behaviour in Crowds for Automatic Congestion Detection
		2013_Hydrodynamic lens
		
	These data make detected pedestrian interchangeable, can't illustrate experience or cognitive level, hard to environment, setup, cost	

3. What are newly collectable data making current model more robust and powerful? How they enhance current models?, 
	+ force-agent based model: identifiable, cognitive level (mental map, friend-graph), illustrate physiological force- force more clearly, collected then repeatedly for simulation in various infrastructure and crowd dynamics, route choice for layout design assessment
	+ meso: real-time density, average velocity in micro-flows wrapping as response function for evacuation plan in cost function
	+ macro: real-time density
	+ Give out the computational implementation framework
4. How to validate the force-agent model?
	+ by real-observation, in n-fold validation, give out the architecture for validation, http://eig.stanford.edu/safegress/index.html, matrices will be compare with fact
	+ by survey, ask whether they go on route choice, experience
	
5. How to manage vast collected data in real-time?
	+Big data architecture
	
6. How to setup experiment on social aspect? 
	Ask by survey: experience or not, and then perform calibrate, present case studies in Monash, Conference, shopping mall in high-dense
		+ To make the application more interesting:
		  Real-time: Heat map of density, find friend's location
		  Long-time: potential hazardous, frequent visit, search space, your frequently nearby friend.
		  
7. Is there a chance to collect data in real-emergence situation when camera hasn't been setup?
	+ Deploy in places where easily occur disasters
	+ Stress fact model, revised from normal model, receive information, feedback from other people in different disaster happened including ship, aviation, oil, fire
	+ Read about Disney RnD, ask person's survey, scripts to modify models with happened disasters by their agent
	+ Example as 2014_Development of an Open-Source Mobile in Data Collection for Disaster
	+ Read about Data Collection from Netherlands
	+ Read about Oxford_ http://eig.stanford.edu/safegress/

8. How does collected data and modified model help on disaster prevention (in crowd simulation on various layout, on evacuation plan -route search space, risky, potential hazardous, convex)

Contribution:
		-Novel Data for crowd dynamic research community
		-Validation area since current state of the art only focus on calibrate and manually perform trajectory
		-Optimisation techniques for evacuation plan
		-Disaster prevention utility: design layout assessment from collected agent, evacuation route search space, real-time crowd context
