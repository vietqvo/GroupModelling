\chapter{Introduction}

Since over 70\% of the world population is predicted to live in cities by 2050 \cite{Weidmann2012}, rapid urbanization and population growth will be inevitable challenges in the effort of planning infrastructure, estimating traffic needs and capacities, and increasing the safety of pedestrians. With the increase in the number of public events and the number of accidents during these events since the crush disaster happened at the Station Nightclub, USA (2003) \cite{Evers2011}, the demand for realistic crowd simulation models becomes important for risk management in urban design and crowd safety. To develop realistic simulation models, various studies have been conducted in order to understand and simulate behaviours which can emerge in both normal and emergency situations such as groups of pedestrians moving with or competing against each other.

Group cohesion behaviour is the behaviour of objects moving towards the average positions of their neighbors over the time \cite{Reynolds1987}. The definition of this behaviour was motivated by the visual observation of coherently flying objects. The behaviour has been investigated widely on the collective motion of different flocking organisms including homing pigeon flocks \cite{Kattas2012}, fish schools \cite{Miller2013}, and bacteria colony \cite{Cisneros2007}. 

Human group cohesion behaviour is observed by its cohesion degree and formation. Cohesion degree denotes the average distance to the group’s centre of mass from each group member while observable human group formations are V-like, line-abreast, U-like, or river-like \cite {Helbing2005}. Group cohesion behaviour is important in both normal and evacuation scenarios. In normal situations, group cohesion behaviour can affect the speed and movement direction of pedestrians who are not belonging to any group. In human behaviour research, the frequency of group cohesion behaviour’s occurrence has been observed at different places in the UK with the percentages of 37\% at train station, 50\% at shopping centre, 28\% at university campus, 50\%, at Clumber Street \cite{Singh2009}. Pedestrians in the same group might be family members, colleagues. In crowd disasters, pedestrians evacuate with group rather than escape individually. Groups of families and friends with strong ties, stay together and evacuate together have been emphasized through socio-psychological research area \cite {Mawson2005}. They may move irrationally to maintain its cohesion and consequently become obstacles for other pedestrians \cite{Aguirre2011}.

%\chapter{Literature Review}
% often it is handy to keep the text of separate chapters in separate
% files, and then to read them into the master document, as here
\include{litrevharvard} % this causes a page-break, so put the \chapter
						% command in the file to be included - I don't know
						% why this happens :(

\chapter{Figures and Tables}
Here we will test that references to figures and tables work correctly.

\section{Tables}
