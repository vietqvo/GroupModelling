\chapter{Introduction}
Since over 70\% of the world population is predicted to live in cities by 2050 \cite{Weidmann2012}, rapid urbanization and population growth will be inevitable challenges in the effort of planning infrastructure, estimating traffic needs and capacities, and increasing the safety of pedestrians. With the increase in the number of public events and the number of accidents during these events since the crush disaster happened at the Station Nightclub, USA (2003) \cite{Evers2011}, the demand for realistic crowd simulation models becomes important for risk management in urban design and crowd safety. To develop realistic simulation models, various studies have been conducted in order to understand and simulate behaviours which can emerge in both normal and emergency situations such as groups of pedestrians moving with or competing against each other.

Group cohesion behaviour is the behaviour of objects moving towards the average positions of their neighbors over the time \cite{Reynolds1987}. The definition of this behaviour was motivated by the visual observation of coherently flying objects. The behaviour has been investigated widely on the collective motion of different flocking organisms including homing pigeon flocks \cite{Kattas2012}, fish schools \cite{Miller2013}, and bacteria colony \cite{Cisneros2007}. 

Human group cohesion behaviour is observed by its cohesion degree and formation. Cohesion degree denotes the average distance to the group’s centre of mass from each group member while observable human group formations are V-like, line-abreast, U-like, or river-like \cite {Helbing2005}. Group cohesion behaviour is important in both normal and evacuation scenarios. In normal situations, group cohesion behaviour can affect the speed and movement direction of pedestrians who are not belonging to any group. In human behaviour research, the frequency of group cohesion behaviour’s occurrence has been observed at different places in the UK with the percentages of 37\% at train station, 50\% at shopping centre, 28\% at university campus, 50\%, at Clumber Street \cite{Singh2009}. Pedestrians in the same group might be family members, colleagues. In crowd disasters, pedestrians evacuate with group rather than escape individually. Groups of families and friends with strong ties, stay together and evacuate together have been emphasized through socio-psychological research area \cite {Mawson2005}. They may move irrationally to maintain its cohesion and consequently become obstacles for other pedestrians \cite{Aguirre2011}.

Various models have been constructed to understand group cohesion behaviour such as the cellular automata model, the social-force based model, the standard Vicsek model. These models mainly investigate how model’s outputs which are group’s formation, cohesion degree, and speed change when group population size varies, or explore the collective behaviour of flocking organisms at randomly chosen values of model’s parameters. However, they have not investigate systematically model’s input parameters to explore the most influential parameters which control group information, and how group cohesion affect individuals to make them maintain group cohesion. Yet, the impact of group cohesion behaviour caused by model’s parameters on flow rate which is a crucial measurement of crowd modelling also has not been studied in current studies. Therefore, this PhD study aims to resolve these two research gaps by using systematic analysis methods and proposed simulation scenarios when considering group is the collection of members have the same scalar parameter value or different parameter distributions. This work is to advance our knowledge about model’s the most influential parameters for improving real-time prediction systems and calibration works based on these models, and the impact of group cohesion on flow rate measurement for predicting empty and occupied space for evacuation plan.

Chapter 2 of this report represents the state of the art from models trying to understand group cohesion behaviour. Chapter 3 analyses the drawbacks of current models and presents the need of this research study. Chapter 4 presents proposed research questions. Chapter 5 presents research methodology to resolve these questions. Chapter 6 reports the contribution of this study. Chapter 7 reports current working progress and research timeline to answer these questions. Finally, Chapter 8 outlines compulsory research training hours undertaken in the IT faculty.

\chapter{Literature Review}

This chapter reviews current models that have been constructed to understand group cohesion behaviour. Modelling approaches are various from modelling the changes of each cell on a grid layout, investigating social forces that affect each pedestrian’s acceleration, to providing standard Vicsek model which has been applied widely in flocking organisms with fewer parameters to simulate group members.
