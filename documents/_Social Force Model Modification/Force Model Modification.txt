1- Force model's general equation (2002) is constructed by Dirk Helbing through observation:

2 - The equation's extension in various aspects:
	+ Social psychological, group cohesion, communication issues could be represented into functions, parameters
		+ Social group, or friend  in repulsive force(Xi's model, 2010).
		+ Walking behaviour of pedestrian social groups (Moussaid & Helbing, 2010).
	+ Customizable parameters
		+ Individual personalities _ patience, overtake the person in front while a patient pedestrian will probably slow down and follow (Zhang, 2002)	
	+ Computational burden when it computes force between pair in simulation
		+ Interaction force between two particles is only in piecewise linear function based on distance between two particles (distance and nor velocities of them) in 1,5,3 metres. (He√Øgeas, 2003)
		+ Cut off distance and vision range in repulsive force_(Xi's model, 2010)
	+ Additional parameters towards specific scenarios (panic context, cross-walk)
		+ (Braun, 2006) - assistance force in panic
		+ (Zeng, 2014) adds a new avoidance force at cross-walk path
		+ (Robert, 2009) -Multi agents behaviour in tsunami

3- With the increase of computational power, current crowd simulation try to integrate various factors for pedestrian-agents to simulate more realistic scenarios
		+(Pelechano, 2006) Roles, Communication, group leader  incorporate with force model, communicate share mental map, follow leaders
		+(Wijermans, 2013) agent's cognitive information to simulate physiological demands
		+(Sun, 2014) generic behaviour, define various factors for agent to make the simulation more heterogeneous
		+(Andrew, 2014) Do-group mater? is the first paper consider about agent in crowd behaviour. Stochastic move to exit or follow leader on agent's decision making is better than
		average rule using force model in evacuation time. This is the first effort in making agent more heterogeneous.
	
However, they haven't considered following aspects:
	+ Lack the standard validation mechanism describing the effect of parameter's distribution on force's formula in crowd scenarios simulation( mentioned by Sun, 2014, Wijermans, 2013)
	+ Lack cognitive level, internal process to simulate decision making in force formula. (as the latest survey in crowd modelling - Hoogendoorn, 2013)
		+Inspired by biological studies on Ant's decision route choice (Loreto ,2013) and fishing school(Couzin, 2013)
		+Inspired by cognitive level(Wijermans, 2013)
		
3- Our interest is at exploring the effect of various values on agent's parameters in simulating crowd phenomena based on force model.	
	Physical attributes:	
		3.1 Desired speed, average speed
		3.2 Body mass
		3.3	AgentMaxSpeed can be increased or decreased
		3.4 Adjuster increase and decreased
		3.5 Expected distance to avoid obstacles
4- Our study on integrating temporal information, and human experience on force model to simulate
		4.1 Cognitive level: 
		4.2 Route directions including exit routes, and its cost
		4.3 Panic level
		4.4 Known obstacle positions
		4.5 Psychological friend-based graph

Current agent's status
		2.1 x and y coordinate of agent location
		2.2 dir is the current direction of agent
		2.3 current speed
